They cover the various methodologies and tools an organization can adopt to transition into DevOps, looking at both agile and lean project management principles and how old-school principles like ITIL, ITSM, and SDLC fit within DevOps.
The course concludes with a discussion of the three main tenets of DevOps—infrastructure automation, continuous delivery, and designing resilient systems—as well as some additional resources and what the future holds.
This course is part of a Professional Certificate from PagerDuty.
